# aws-back-personal-example
This is an example of an AWS backend architecture using CloudFormation and Python. Here are some examples of layers, Lambdas, SQS, SNS, Cognito user pool, API Gateway integrated with Cognito, and more.

# How do I deploy this?
## You can use this project as an example. However, for some reasons, some code has been deleted. But the main idea is here: create multiple stacks, deploy them, integrate them, use different aws services, create a github pipeline for deploying them and more.
### note: I have an example of how to integrate Stripe payments with your frontend. If you need it, just write to me.
